# DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: K V N AISWARYA LAKSHMI DEVI

**INTERN ID**: CT08HIU

**DOMAIN**: DATA SCIENCE

**BATCH DURATION**: DECEMBER 30th, 2024 to JANUARY 30th, 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTOSH

**DESCRIPTION**:

This project develops an image classification system using TensorFlow and the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. The data is preprocessed by normalizing pixel values, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers for feature extraction and classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, trained for several epochs with validation metrics tracked to monitor progress. Post-training, the modelâ€™s accuracy is evaluated on test data, and training results are visualized through accuracy and loss plots. Predictions are demonstrated on test images, displaying predicted labels for qualitative assessment. Implemented in Python with TensorFlow and Matplotlib, this project provides an efficient and scalable solution for image classification, demonstrating the principles and practical application of deep learning techniques.
